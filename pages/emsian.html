<h2>GSSP for Emsian Stage</h2>

<h4 class="definition">Definition:</h4>
<p class="definition">The base of the Emsian Stage is located at the base of Bed 9/5 in the Zinzil'ban Gorge in the Kitab State Geological Reserve, 170km SSE of Samarkand, Uzbekistan. The GSSP for the Emsian Stage coincides with the first occurrence of the conodont <i>Polygnathus kitabicus</i> within the phylogenetic succession from <i>Polygnathus pireneae</i> to <i>Polygnathus kitabicus</i>.</p>

<h4>Location:</h4>
<p>The GSSP is located at the base of Bed 9/5 in the Zinzil'ban Gorge in the Kitab State Geological Reserve, 170km SSE of Samarkand, Uzbekistan. The GSSP is at a latitude of 39°12' North and a longitude of 67°18'20&quot; E of Greenwich.</p>
<p>The GSSP occurs in a relatively uniform sequence of dark micritic limestones, characterized by lack of significant abrupt faunal change. The GSSP at the base of Bed 9/5 is located 35cm above the top of the Madmon Formation on the western wall of the Zinzil'ban Gorge.</p>

<h4>Primary Markers:</h4>
<p>The GSSP for the Emsian Stage coincides with the first occurrence of the conodont <i>Polygnathus kitabicus</i> within the phylogenetic succession from <i>Polygnathus pireneae</i> to <i>Polygnathus kitabicus</i> (formerly <i>Polygnathus dehiscens</i>). Because of uncertainties regarding the holotype of <i>P. dehiscens</i> a new specific name was proposed for a specimen from the GSSP section, <i>Polygnathus kitabicus</i>. Some conodont workers regard <i>Polygnathus kitabicus</i> as a junior synonym to <i>Polygnathus dehiscens</i>.</p>

<h4>Correlation Events:</h4>
<p>Conodont FAD <i>Polygnathus kitabicus</i></p>

<h4>Other Locations around the World:</h4>
<p>The phylogenetic lineage from <i>Polygnathus pireneae</i> to <i>Polygnathus kitabicus</i> can be recognized in Spain, Australia, North America, Tajikistan and China.</p>
