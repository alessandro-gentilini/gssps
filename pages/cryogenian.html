<h2>GSSP for Cryogenian Stage</h2>

<h4 class="definition">Definition:</h4>
<p class="definition">The base of the Calabrian System will be placed at a globally correlative level that lies stratigraphically beneath the first appearance of widespread glaciation and is assigned in the interim a ‘calibrated age’ of circa 720 Ma. This definition should be used in publications until a formal Cryogenian GSSP can be ratified.</p>
