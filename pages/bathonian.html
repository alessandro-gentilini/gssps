<h2>GSSP for Bathonian Stage</h2>

<h4 class="definition">Definition:</h4>
<p class="definition">The base of the Bathonian
Stage is defined at the base of limestone bed RB071 in the Ravin du Bès
Section, Bas-Auran area, southern Subalpine Chains, France. The boundary
coincides with the first occurrence of the ammonites <i>Gonolkites convergens</i>
and <i>Morphoceras parvum</i>.</p>

<h4>Location:</h4>
<p>The GSSP of the Bathonian Stage is located in the Bas-Auran area, southern
Subalpine Chains, France, approximately 25 km SSE of Digne-les-Bains. The
GSSP is located at a latitude of 43°57’38&quot;N and a longitude of
6º18’55&quot;E.</p>
<p>The GSSP succession is a cyclic marl-limestone alternation. In the Bas-Auran
area, Lower Bathonian deposits comprise black or gray limestone beds
alternating with marls. The Bajocian - Bathonian Boundary is defined at the
base of limestone bed RB071. These deposits are relatively uniform mudstones
to wackestones, with common ammonoids, scarce sponges and very scarce
nautiloids, brachiopods, bivalves, belemnites, echinoids, crinoids and
gastropods.</p>


<h4>Primary Markers:</h4>
<p><b>Ammonites:</b> The boundary coincides with the first
occurrrence of the ammonites <i>Gonolkites convergens</i> and <i>Morphoceras
parvum</i>.</p>

<h4>Secondary Markers:</h4>
<p><b>Nannofossils:</b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'> The FO of <i>Watznaueria
barnesiae</i> (NJT11) was observed in sample 68a of earliest Bathonian age
(Zigzag Zone). This event defines the base of the Tethyan NJT11 Zone,
comparable to most of the Boreal NJ11 Zone and NJ12a Subzone.</p>

<h4>Correlation Events:</h4>
<p>Ammonite FAD <i>Gonolkites convergens</i>
(defines base of <i>Zigzagiceras zigzag</i> Zone)</p>

<h4>Other Locations around the World:</h4>
<p>An auxiliary section for the Bathonian
Stage is located in Cabo Mondego, 40 km west of Coimbra, 7 km north of Figueira
da Foz, Portugal (40°11'18&quot;N, 8°54'30&quot;W). It provides complementary
data about the ammonite succession and biochronostratigraphic subdivision of
the Sub- Mediterranean <i>parvum</i> Subzone and the Northwest European <i>convergens</i>
Subzone.</p>
