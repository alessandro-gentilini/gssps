<h2>GSSP for Sheinwoodian Stage</h2>

<h4 class="definition">Definition:</h4>
<p class="definition">The base of the Wenlock Series and Sheinwoodian Stage is located at the base of the Buildwas Formation along the northern bank of Hughley Brook, 200m south-east of Leasows Farm.</p>

<h4>Location:</h4>
<p>The GSSP is located along the northern bank of Hughley Brook at SO 5688 9839, 200m south-east of Leasows Farm and 500m north-east of Hughley Church.</p>
<p>The GSSP lies at the base of Unit G of the Buildwas Formation. Unit G is comprised of grey-green mudstones at the base, becoming blue-grey upwards, with comminuted bryozoans, pelmatozoans, brachiopods, corals, etc.</p>

<h4>Primary Markers:</h4>
<p>The base of the Sheinwoodian Stage lies close to the base of the <i>Cyrtograptus centrifugus</i> Graptolite Biozone. </p>

<h4>Secondary Markers:</h4>
<p><b>Conodonts:</b><br />
Basal beds of the Buildwas Formation contain diverse conodonts of the <i>Pterospathodus amorphognathoides</i> interval.</p>

<h4>Correlation Events:</h4>
<p>Imprecise. Between the base of acritarch biozone 5 and LAD of conodont <i>Pterospathodus amorphognathoides</i>. The current GSSP does not coincide with the base of the <i>Cyrtograptus centrifugus</i> Biozone, as was supposed when the GSSP was defined. Restudy recommends a slightly higher and correlatable level on condonts -- the Ireviken datum 2, which coincides approximately with the base of the <i>murchisoni</i> Graptolite Biozone</p>
