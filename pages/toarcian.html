<h2>GSSP for Toarcian Stage</h2>

<h4 class="definition">Definition:</h4>
<p class="definition">Toarcian Stage (lower Jurassic) is defined at the bed 15e in Ponta do Trovão, Peniche, Portugal. This level is characterized by mass occurrence of <i>Dactylioceras</i> ammonite species, namely by the first occurrence (FO) of <i>Dactylioceras</i><i> (Eodactylites) simplex</i> co-occurring with <i>D. (E.) pseudocommune </i>and<i> D. (E.) polymorphum</i>. This species define the lower part of the Polymorphum Zone, Mirabile Subzone. The ammonite association of <i>Dactylioceras</i><i> (Eodactylites)</i> ssp. and other species such as <i>Protogrammoceras</i> (<i>Paltarpites</i>) cf. paltum</i>, Lioceratoides</i> aff. <i>balinense</i> and Tiltoniceras</i> aff. <i>capillatum</i> is particularly significant for the boundary definition. Secondary biostratigraphic events are represented by a succession of calcareous nannofossil first occurrences observed across the Pliensbachian/Toarcian boundary, namely the FOs of <i>Lotharingius</i><i> velatus</i>, <i>Biscutum</i><i> intermedium </i>(uppermost Pliensbachian), <i>Discorhabdus</i><i> ignotus</i> and <i>Carinolithus</i><i> superbus</i> (lower Toarcian) are recorded in Peniche as well as in other expanded Tethyan sections. Secondary global marker includes a <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratio of 0.70706 (±2s) at the base of the Toarcian.</p>

<h4>Location:</b>h4>
<p>The GSSP section at Ponta do Trovão is located near the Peniche town (Peniche peninsula), approximately 80 km north of Lisbon (Portugal) at a latitude of 39º22’15’’ N, and a longitude of 9º23’07’’ W.</p>

<h4>Sedimentology:</b>h4>
<p>The base of the Toarcian Stage at Ponta do Trovão, Peniche, is the uppermost part of the Lemede Fm corresponding to the <i>Couches de passage </i>(Transition beds). These beds are bioturbated, centimetre-thick marlstones enriched in bioclasts alternating with decimeter-thick bioclastic limestones with a wackestone texture. The highest bed of the <i>Couches de passage</i> (15e) has yielded a characteristic association of dactylioceratids that is classically interpreted as marking the beginning of the Toarcian. As a consequence, the chronostratigraphical boundary at the base of bed 15e is distinct from the lithologic boundary, this latter being situated between the <i>Couches de passage</i> (top of bed 15e, topmost part of Lemede Fm) and the base of the Cabo Carvoeiro Fm (bed 16a), which is represented by decimetre-thick alternations of marls and centimetre-thick limestones.</p>

<h4>Primary Markers:</h4>
<p>The GSSP is marked by the FO of the ammonite <i>D. (E.) simplex</i> co-occurring with <i>D. (E.) pseudocommune </i>and<i> D. (E.) polymorphum</i>.</p>

<p><b>Secondary Markers:</b>
<br />Ammonite association of <i>D. (Eodactylites)</i> ssp. and other species e.g. Protogrammoceras</i> (Paltarpites</i>) cf. paltum</i>, Lioceratoides</i> aff. <i>balinense</i> and Tiltoniceras</i> aff. <i>capillatum</i> is particularly significant for the boundary definition. A succession of calcareous nannofossil first occurrences includes the FOs of <i>L. velatus</i>, <i>B. intermedium </i>(uppermost Pliensbachian), <i>D. ignotus</i> and <i>C. superbus</i> (lower Toarcian). A prominent (~2‰) negative excursion of d<sup>13</sup>C measured on bulk rock, belemnites and brachiopod calcite is also recorded just above the boundary level.</p>

<p><b>Strontium Isotopes:</b><br />
Analysis of belemnites yields a calcite <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr ratio for the boundary level of 0.70706.</p>
<p><b>Magnetostratigraphy:</b><br />
Magnetostratigraphy was not conclusive in the Peniche section. A very precise correlation with the Almonacid de la Cuba section (Iberian Range, Spain), based upon ammonite and Sr isotopes, shows that the Pliensbachian/Toarcian boundary nearly corresponds to the transition between a normal and a reversed polarity.</p>

<h4>Correlation Events:</h4>
<p>Ammonite association of <i>D. (Eodactylites)</i> ssp. and other species e.g. <i>Protogrammoceras</i> (Paltarpites</i>) cf. paltum</i>, Lioceratoides</i> aff. <i>balinense</i> and Tiltoniceras</i> aff. <i>capillatum</i> is particularly significant for the boundary definition.</p>

<h4>Notes on Derivation of Age:</h4>
<p>Correlation to the Karoo volcanic rocks provided absolute age. Cyclostratigraphy was performed on the basal Toarcian of Peniche section.</p>
