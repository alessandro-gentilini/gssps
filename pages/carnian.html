<h2>GSSP for Carnian Stage</h2>


<h4 class="definition">Definition:</h4>
<p class="definition">The GSSP for the base of the Carnian Stage is defined on the north face of the Cordevole Valley, on the southern slopes of the crest separating the Badia/Abtei and the Cordevole valleys, (46° 31' 37&quot;N, 11° 55' 49&quot;E) at an elevation of 1980 m, approximately 4.7 km south of San Cassiano/St. Kassian in the Dolomites (Southern Alps). The GSSP boundary is located at the base of bed SW4, 45 m above the base of the San Cassiano Fm.</p>


<h4>Location:</h4>
<p>On the north face of the Cordevole Valley, on the southern slopes of the crest separating the Badia/Abtei and the Cordevole valleys, (46° 31' 37&quot;N, 11° 55' 49&quot;E) at an elevation of 1980 m, approximately 4.7 km south of San Cassiano/St. Kassian in the Dolomites (Southern Alps).</p>
<p>The section consists of hemipelagites and thin turbidite beds (both siliciclastic and carbonate intraclastic), deposited below storm wave-base with a high but variable sediment accumulation rate (San Cassiano Fm.).</p>

<h4>Primary Markers:</h4>
<p>FAD of the ammonoids <i>Daxatina
canadensis</i> (Whiteaves).</p>

<h4>Secondary Markers:</h4>
<p>FAD of the conodont <i>Paragondolella polygnathiformis</i> (Budurov and Stefanov), appearing 70 cm above the first occurrence of <i>Daxatina canadensis</i> and at the base of a long normal-polarity magnetic zone (S2n) in close proximity to the boundary.</p>

<p><b>Radiometric Dating:</b></p>

<b>Stable Carbon Isotopes:</b></p>

<h4>Correlation Events:</h4>
<p>FAD of the ammonoid <i>Daxatina canadensis</i>; just below FO of conodont <i>Paragondolella polygnathiformis</i> and base of normal-polarity magnetic zone S2n</p>

<h4>Other Locations around the World:</h4>

<h4>Notes on Derivation of Age:</h4>
<p>The GSSP is one ammonite subzone just above a level dated at 237.77 ± 0.14 Ma.</p>
