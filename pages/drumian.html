<h2>GSSP for Drumian Stage</h2> 

<h4 class="definition">Definition:</h4>
<p class="definition">The base of the Drumian Stage (= middle stage of the third series of the Cambrian System) is defined at the base of a dark-gray thinly laminated limestone (calcisiltite) layer, 62 m above the base of the Wheeler Formation, along the ridge crest of a section known informally as &quot;Stratotype Ridge&quot; in the Drum Mountains, northern Millard County, western Utah, USA. This level coincides with the lowest occurrence of the agnostoid trilobite <i>Ptychagnostus atavus</i>. Secondary indicators near the GSSP include the DICE negative Î´13C excursion , the onset of a long monotonic 87Sr/86Sr isotopic shift, and a transgressive phase of an eustatic event.</p> 

<h4>Location:</h4>
<p>The Drumian Section is situated along the ridge crest of a section known informally as &quot;Stratotype Ridge&quot; in the Drum Mountains, northern Millard County, western Utah, USA, at a latitude of 39°30.705&quot;N and a longitude of 112°59.489&quot;W. The Drumian section is located 39km WNW of Delta, Utah.</p> 

The GSSP occurs within the Wheeler Formation, which consists of a succession of light- to dark-gray, and lavender-gray, thin-bedded calcareous shales, interbedded with medium- to dark-gray, thin-bedded calcisiltite beds. The GSSP is defined at the base of a dark-gray thinly laminated limestone (calcisiltite) layer, 62 m above the base of the Wheeler Formation.</p> 

<h4>Primary Markers:</h4>
<p><b>Trilobites:</b><br /> The GSSP coincides with the lowest occurrence of the agnostoid trilobite <i>Ptychagnostus atavus</i>.</p>

<h4>Secondary Markers:</h4>
<p><b>Trilobites:</b><br />
Just below the GSSP is the base of the Laurentian polymerid trilobite <i>Bolaspidella Zone</i>. Just above the GSSP is the highest occurrence of the cosmopolitan agnostoid trilobite <i>Ptychagnostus gibbus</i> and the base of the Baltic-Gondwanan conodont <i>Gapparodus bisulcatus</i>-<i>Westergaardodina brevidens</i> Zone.<br />
<b>Conodonts:</b><br />
Just above the GSSP is the base of the Baltic-Gondwanan conodont <i>Gapparodus bisulcatus</i>-<i>Westergaardodina brevidens</i> Zone.<br />
<b>Carbon Isotopes:</b><br />
72m above the base of the Wheeler Formation and 10m above the GSSP occurs the DICE negative δ<sup>13</sup>C excursion.</p>

<h4>Correlation Events:</h4>
<p>Trilobite FAD <i>Ptychagnostus atavus</i></p>

<h4>Other Locations around the World:</h4>
<p>The first occurrence of <i>Ptychagnostus atavus</i> is recognized worldwide. This species is used as a zonal guide fossil in Australia, South China, Kazakhstan, and Laurentia.</p>
