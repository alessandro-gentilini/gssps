<h2>GSSP for Rhuddanian Stage</h2>

<h4 class="definition">Definition:</h4>
<p class="definition">The base of the Silurian System and Rhuddanian Stage is defined at 1.6m above the base of the Birkhill Shale Formation, in a section at Dob's Linn, near Moffat in the Southern Uplands of Scotland, U.K., and coincides with the first appearance of the graptolite <i>Akidograptus ascensus</i>, defining the base of the <i>A. ascensus Biozone</i>.<br />
[Note: The previously published assignment as coincident with the local base of the <i>Parakidograptus acuminatus</i> Zone is now known to be incorrect, and this had caused conflicting and confusing correlations.<br />

<h4>Location:</h4>
<p>The GSSP for the Silurian is located in a section at Dob's Linn in an artificial excavation created just north of the Linn Branch Stream (U.K. National Grid Reference NT 1962 1584).</p>
<p>Two lithological units (formations) occur near the boundary. The lower is the Hartfell Shale (48m thick), consisting chiefly of pale gray mudstone with subordinate black shales and several interbedded meta-bentonites. Above this is the 43m-thick Birkhill Shale, which consist predominantly of black graptolitic shale with subordinate gray mudstones and meta-bentonites.</p>

<h4>Primary Markers:</h4>
<p>Incoming of graptolites <i>Akidograptus ascensus</i> and <i>Parakidograptus praematurus</i> at 1.6m above the base of the Birkhill Shale Formation.</p>

<h4>Secondary Markers:</h4>
<p>Chitinozoa and conodonts are known from the section, but are neither well preserved nor very age diagnostic.</p>

<h4>Correlation Events:</h4>
<p>Graptolite FAD <i>Akidograptus ascensus</i></p>
