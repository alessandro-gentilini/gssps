<h2>Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Points</h2>
<p>Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points (GSSPs) are reference points on stratigraphic sections of rock which define the lower boundaries of stages on the International Chronostratigraphic Chart. Since 1977, the ICS has maintained the international GSSP register.</p>

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>A geologic section has to fulfill a set of criteria to be adapted as a GSSP by the ICS. The following list summarizes the criteria where the imperetive words <em>SHOULD</em> and <em>MUST</em> are defined according to <a title="Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels. S. Bradner. IETF. March 1997. Best Current Practice. URL: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119">RCF2119</a>:</p>
<ol>
    <li>A GSSP section <em>MUST</em> contain a stratigraphic marker that recognizes the lower boundary of a geologic Stage</li>
    <li>
        The boundary <em>MUST</em> be recognized by an observable, unambiguous change in the physical properties or fossil content of the strata, for example the first appearance datum of a fossil species
        <ul>
            <li>There <em>SHOULD</em> be other physical manifestations (secondary markers) that can be used to locate the boundary, e.g. other fossils, chemical changes, geomagnetic reversal</li>
            <li>The section in which the marker appears <em>SHOULD</em> have layers containing minerals that can be radiometrically dated to assign ages to the depositional events at or bracketing the boundary horizon</li>
            <li>The primary or secondary marker events <em>MUST</em> be manifested in regional and global stratigraphic sections to allow correlation in outcrops of the same age</li>
            <li>The markers should be independent of facies</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The outcropping stratigraphic section containing the GSSP marker <em>MUST</em> have adequate thickness to support global correlation</li>
    <li>Sedimentation in the section containing the boundary must <em>MUST</em> be continuous without any changes in facies</li>
    <li>The section containing the marker <em>SHOULD</em> be unaffected by tectonic and sedimentary movements, and metamorphism</li>
    <li>
        The section containing the marker must <em>MUST</em> be accessible to research and free to access
        <ul>
            <li>The section containing the marker <em>SHOULD</em> be located where it can be visited quickly and <em>SHOULD</em> be kept in good condition (ideally a national reserve), in accessible terrain, extensive enough to allow repeated sampling and open to researchers of all nationalities</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The fossil content in the boundary interval SHOULD be abundant, distinctive, well preserved, and represent a fauna and/or flora as cosmopolitan and as diverse as possible.</li>
    <li>In order to ensure its acceptance and use in the Earth sciences, a boundary stratotype SHOULD contain as many specific marker horizons or other attributes as possible favorable for long-distance correlation.</li>
</ol>
