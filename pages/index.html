<h2>Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Points</h2>
<p>Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points (GSSPs) are reference points on stratigraphic sections of rock which define the lower boundaries of stages on the geologic timescale. Since 1977, the ICS has maintained the international GSSP register.</p>

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>A geologic section has to fulfill a set of criteria to be adapted as a GSSP by the ICS. The following list summarizes the criteria:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A GSSP has to define the lower boundary of a geologic Stage</li>
    <li>
        The lower boundary has to be defined using a primary marker (usually first appearance datum of a fossil species)
        <ul>
            <li>There should also be secondary markers (other fossils, chemical, geomagnetic reversal)</li>
            <li>The horizon in which the marker appears should have minerals that can be radiometrically dated</li>
            <li>The marker has to have regional and global correlation in outcrops of the same age</li>
            <li>The marker should be independent of facies</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The outcrop has to have an adequate thickness</li>
    <li>Sedimentation has to be continuous without any changes in facies</li>
    <li>The outcrop should be unaffected by tectonic and sedimentary movements, and metamorphism</li>
    <li>
        The outcrop has to be accessible to research and free to access
        <ul>
            <li>This includes that the outcrop has to be located where it can be visited quickly (International airport and good roads), has to be kept in good condition (Ideally a national reserve), in accessible terrain, extensive enough to allow repeated sampling and open to researchers of all nationalities</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Locations</h3>
<p>GSSPs are spread throughout the world. The map below indicates each's approximate location.</p>
