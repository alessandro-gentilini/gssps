<h2>GSSP for Fortunian Stage</h2>



<h4 class="definition">Definition:</h4>

<p class="definition">The base of the Phanerozoic
Eon, Paleozoic Era and Cambrian System is defined in a coastal section near the
town of Fortune in southeastern Newfoundland, Canada. The GSSP lies 2.4m above
the base of Member 2 in the Chapel Island Formation, just above the transition
to storm-influenced facies. The level is marked by the first occurrence of <i>Trichophycus
pedum</i> (a trace fossil).</p>


  <h4>Location:</h4>
  <p>The
  Fortune Head Section is situated near the tip of the Burin Peninsula, near
  the town of Fortune, southeastern Newfoundland, in low cliffs that extended
  beyond &quot;Fortune Dump&quot; at a latitude of 47.0762°N and a longitude of
  55.8310°W.</p>




Coastal
  cliff exposures at Fortune Head display some 400m of the Chapel Island
  Formation. Member 1 consists of peritidal sandstone and shales. Member 2A
  consists of storm-influenced muddy deltaic and shelf sandstones and
  mudstones. Member 2B and 3 consist of thinly laminated siltstones of the
  distal shelf, deposited below wave base.</p>




<h4>Primary Markers:</h4>

<p>First occurrence of the trace fossil <i>Trichophycus
pedum</i>.</p>

<h4>Secondary Markers:</h4>
<p><b>Trace fossils:</b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'><br />
Member 1 of the Chapel Island Formation includes uppermost Precambrian
sediments. It yields the trace fossils <i>Harlaniella podolica</i> and <i>Palaeopascichnus
delicatus</i>. These trace fossils range into Member 2, where they are last
seen 0.2m below the GSSP.</p>

<h4>Correlation Events:</h4>

<p>Trace fossil FAD <i>Trichophycus pedum</i>
</p>

<h4>Notes on Derivation of Age:</h4>

<p>U-Pb age from Oman coinciding with the
negative carbon excursion</p>
